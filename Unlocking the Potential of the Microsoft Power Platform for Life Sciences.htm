  <p class=MsoTitle><span lang=EN-US>Unlocking the Potential of the Microsoft
  Power Platform for Life Sciences</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:105%'><span lang=EN-US>For over a
  decade, we have been supporting a Life Science customer with a legacy .NET
  application. Keeping aging infrastructure running is costly and increasingly
  unsustainable, with 60 to 80 per cent of corporate IT budgets going towards
  maintaining legacy systems. Our customer approached us to link the
  application to their new Quality Management System.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:105%'><span lang=EN-US>Our challenge
  was to reconstruct outdated custom .NET applications that manipulated
  documents and integrated with other systems, as well as redirect printing
  services to Ricoh's follow-me printing. Meeting strict regulations working
  for a Life Science company, we needed precise data and documents to support
  the production process, which included both digital and paper-based
  solutions. Document templates were stored in the Quality Management System.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:105%'><span lang=EN-US>The solution
  that we proposed was the development of App based on Microsoft Power
  Platform, SharePoint, Azure, and Power Apps. The aim was to provide users
  with the same user experience as the old application, so that a single
  application would deliver all the relevant information for employees to
  perform their tasks in an efficient and safe way.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:105%'><span lang=EN-US>The Microsoft
  Power Platform was selected to build the solution as it allows for quick
  development of enterprise applications based on low code. We coupled the
  Power Platform to Customers Quality Management System (QMS) as a database for
  documents. Power Apps, the low-code development component of the Power
  Platform, was used to develop a user-friendly application covering all needs.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:105%'><span lang=EN-US>The platform was
  customizable to end-users' requirements, and the development cycles were
  short and fast, allowing feedback from end-users to be implemented quickly.
  Authorization management was centralized via Azure Active Directory, ensuring
  that all information displayed in the application could be consulted by
  authorized employees only, and creating and editing the information was
  limited to a group of &quot;contributor&quot; employees. An audit trail
  tracked all interactions in the application.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:105%'><span lang=EN-US>The App on the
  Power Platform proved to be an amazing tool for companies to digitize and
  really impact the daily work of employees. The functional power of the
  solution lay in the fact that everything was nicely integrated with the QMS,
  the Azure function app, and the Ricoh printer service. The application was
  easily adopted by employees as it was completely in line with their needs,
  and the integrated analytics showed that the application was actively being
  used.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:105%'><span lang=EN-US>From an IT
  portfolio perspective, since SharePoint was used in combination with the
  Power App, this also helped towards user adoption of SharePoint and the
  surrounding Microsoft tools within the company. The relatively short
  implementation cycle and related limited budget needs were obviously an
  additional benefit: analysis, design, implementation, and roll-out were all
  covered in less than 50 man-days of work.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:105%'><span lang=EN-US>Technically, the
  fact that the Power Platform offered the possibility to build a custom
  application that is easy to maintain and expand is a great added value.
  So-called &quot;spaghetti&quot; code (extremely unstructured and
  non-maintainable code) was thus avoided, making it a future-proof technology.</span></p>
