  <p class=MsoTitle><span lang=EN-US>content capture the human factor:
  exploring user adoption</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Advances in&nbsp;data capture&nbsp;and
  document recognition technologies are leading more and more organizations to
  integrate them into their content management solutions.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Embedded with advanced artificial
  intelligence&nbsp;(AI)&nbsp;capabilities, these systems scan all incoming
  communications, import documents, recognize and classify data, images or
  videos. But it doesn't end there. After the content type is identified, classified
  and data captured in a digital format, this information is routed within the
  business environment.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>While all this is happening, the AI
  engine enriches the meta-data by reading the content and making decisions as
  if they were done by a human.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Enterprise capture
  management&nbsp;empowers all employees to access the right content at the
  right time, by streamlining the lifecycle of their information. This means
  that from&nbsp;data capture&nbsp;to distribution and archiving, your
  organization is able to virtually eliminate paper-based information and
  enhance content visibility. Not forgetting to combine the necessary content
  compliance and information security functionalities.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Surprisingly, the lack of effective
  adoption is the single largest factor impacting the&nbsp;ROI&nbsp;of
  implementing enterprise capture technologies. From a technical perspective,
  most requirements are feasible. Robotics, automation tooling and content intelligence
  are becoming more and more accessible, requiring less and less in-depth
  expertise on each technology. However, reluctant users who avoid bringing the
  new technology into their day-to-day tasks means you’re not making the most
  of your technology investment.</span></p>
  <h1>The resistance</h1>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>User adoption is oddly related to
  resistance to change.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Although the premise of user adoption is
  changing from an outdated or redundant system to a newer, more efficient one,
  getting everyone on board isn't as easy as you would expect.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Here are a few tips I've picked up over
  the years that can help you get through these challenges.</span></p>
  <h1>1 - Document your content management processes</h1>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Take implementing content management
  process automation powered by artificial intelligence as an example. One of
  the biggest challenges is getting users who know every step of the (manual)
  process to put it in words.&nbsp; Generally this isn't documented and it’s
  the key to identify what steps can be automated and where AI can help make
  their job easier.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>To prevent this, make sure your
  organization is documenting processes by using models and diagrams but keep
  them simple and understandable so that those with no knowledge of business
  process management (BPM) can understand the workflows and suggest improvements.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.5pt;color:#6C7685'>&nbsp;</span>2 -
  Follow the KISS principle</h1>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Implementing content capture technologies
  can seem daunting for organizations with large amounts of critical
  information based on paper and no in-house technical background or know-how.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white;vertical-align:
  baseline'><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>It also takes a lot of effort,
  starting from the teams involved in gathering requirements, to the
  consultants and AI engineers implementing the solution.&nbsp;All&nbsp;AI is
  data-driven, so configuring these types of knowledge management solutions is
  labor intensive due to the sheer amount of data samples it demands.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>By promoting an agile iterative&nbsp;</span><a
  href="https://blog.amplexor.com/taking-fast-track-content-management-projects"><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.5pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"inherit",serif;
  color:#6C7685;text-decoration:none'>implementation approach</span></a><span
  lang=EN-US>&nbsp;we start with a very small reference set, work on that, and
  then move to production as soon as possible. Receiving input from all the
  teams involved in the project and keeping them up-to-date on progress and
  milestones is key. Users need to feel encouraged from the first iteration and
  throughout the development and implementation stages – keeping it simple and
  straightforward helps.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading1Char><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%'>3 - Make sure your teams are
  involved</span></span><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:21.0pt;line-height:
  107%;color:#0B1C34;letter-spacing:-.25pt'><br>
  </span></b><span lang=EN-US>Having worked as an ECM Consultant for
  organizations of all sizes for nearly ten years, I can say that most content
  capture solution implementations are technology driven. There’s usually no
  clear change management strategy to ensure smooth adoption on the end-user
  level.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sure, the company probably has a business
  case and a business sponsor, but when it comes to communicating to users
  what’s changing and how and getting them excited about the project, it’s
  normally a reactive event. Very often we see user adoption initiatives being
  limited to assigning a team member to handle&nbsp;User Acceptance Testing
  (UAT),&nbsp;after which the system is implemented, and an educational video
  is expected to do the job.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>End-users of any technology you’re
  looking to implement should be involved from the early stages of the project.</span></p>
  <h1>4 - Use a timely, frequent and transparent communication</h1>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>What is&nbsp;the purpose of process
  automation and expected improvements in day-to-day work? Have specific
  timelines been set or will the implementation be completed in phases?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white;vertical-align:
  baseline'><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>Sometimes the&nbsp;business
  case is just not clear.&nbsp;And while you don’t need to share every detail
  about the project, communicating key information with your teams early and
  often will keep them in the loop and allow them to know what to expect.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This happened on a project I worked on.
  After requirements intake and building the content capture solution, we moved
  to UAT. An end-user started working with the application and all its
  functionalities: automated data extraction and classification. Basically text
  boxes and fields are automatically populated so less manual input is needed
  from the user. Suddenly, she said: “If this is automated, what am I going to
  do all day?”&nbsp;She had no clue what was going on&nbsp;because the
  organization didn’t focus on change management.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoQuote><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Success consists of going from
  failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.&quot;<br>
  - Winston Churchill</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Focus on your strategy´s goal, make it
  clear and refer to it often. Content capture, artificial intelligence,
  natural language processing and&nbsp;machine learning&nbsp;are all
  intimidating subjects in the workplace with a lot of associated misconceptions.
  Remember that the human factor drives the success of any technology
  deployment - after all, success is measured by the extent to which people
  embrace and incorporate new practices and behaviors into their daily work
  routines, how they adopt and adapt the technology for their own purpose.</span></p>
