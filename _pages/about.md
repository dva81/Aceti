Welcome to my digital space! 

I lead a dynamic team of highly skilled competence and solution leads, driving impactful UiPath and Microsoft Power Platform projects for our enterprise clients. Our focus lies in revolutionizing business processes through Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and comprehensive business automation initiatives.

In my role as a freelance consultant, I specialize in empowering small businesses to optimize their utilization or migration to Microsoft 365. My expertise extends to tailoring the suite to align seamlessly with the unique needs of small enterprises. From enhancing online presence and streamlining communication to effective document management and collaboration, I provide end-to-end assistance.

As a versatile problem-solving professional, I effortlessly integrate into diverse environments. I recognize structures and design streamlined business processes. Over the course of my career, I've made balanced and pragmatic work environments across various sectors, including finance, public services, distribution, construction, and the food industry.

My approach as a people manager centers around considering everyone's perspective, fostering a win-win scenario for both the organization and colleagues. Maintaining an open mind and a negotiable attitude, I am described as sensitive, ambitious, self-developed, driven, results-oriented, decisive, coaching, and immensely eager to learn. Collaborating with people has been a constant and essential aspect of my career journey.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly running and cycling), and spending time with friends and family.
