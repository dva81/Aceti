This tool has been in Windows for some time, but a lot of people still don't know about it. That has to change.

Steps Recorder (called Problems Steps Recorder in Windows 7) is a program that helps you troubleshoot a problem on your device by recording the exact steps you took when the problem occurred. You can then send this record to a support professional to help them diagnose the problem. [Microsoft Steps Recorder](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/record-steps-to-reproduce-a-problem-46582a9b-620f-2e36-00c9-04e25d784e47)

- Steps Recorder doesn t record text that you type (such as a password), except for function and shortcut keys.
- Some programs, like a full-screen game, might not be captured accurately.

But I think it can be used for more, such as:

- Steps recorder can help to map the functional requirements based on steps.
- It can help you with process mining and process analysis.

I use it when I go to a customer and ask them to demo the process in their software. Instead of recording, I use this because it makes screenshots and records actions.

It records steps, actions, click and screenshot and creates a document that you can edit in Word.

After adding some text my analysis document is ready.

# Getting started

Open the application

you can find the application in the start menu of your Windows. Just type in Step Recorder

Set this to 100. Every scroll of the mouse is recorded, so if you are nervous, you'll have a lot of waste**.**
