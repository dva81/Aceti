# Skills vs Connectors in Microsoft Copilot Studio: Making the Right Choice

In the evolving landscape of automation and AI integration, Microsoft Copilot Studio offers two primary methods for enhancing functionality: Skills and Connectors. Understanding the differences, strengths, and best use cases for each can help organizations make informed decisions. This post explores the key aspects of Skills and Connectors, and provides guidance on selecting the right approach for your projects.

## Understanding Connectors

Connectors in the Power Platform provide a low-code solution to integrate various services and applications. This approach is particularly useful for users who want to extend API calls without delving into extensive coding. Here are some key points about Connectors:

- **Preview Availability**: Connectors are currently available in preview within the Power Platform.
- **Low-Code Approach**: Designed for ease of use, enabling users to integrate services with minimal coding.
- **DLP Policy Impact**: Data Loss Prevention policies apply, with standard limitations allowing 500 calls per minute per connector. These limits are adjustable based on the environment.
- **Authentication**: Proper authentication needs to be verified to ensure secure connections.

## Exploring Skills

Skills offer a more flexible, pro-code approach, requiring Azure infrastructure. This method is ideal for users with coding expertise who need to implement complex customizations. Key features of Skills include:

- **Pro-Code Flexibility**: Greater flexibility due to the ability to write and modify code.
- **Azure Infrastructure**: Requires setup and management of Azure resources.
- **Extended Capabilities**: Skills can extend further than connectors, especially when paired with Copilot extensions.

## User Experience in Copilot

Regardless of whether you choose Skills or Connectors, the user experience within Copilot remains largely consistent. Both methods aim to streamline the integration process and enhance functionality.

## Making the Decision

For Proof of Concept (POC) use cases, the primary strategy is to use custom connectors. This approach allows for quick integration and testing without extensive coding. However, it's crucial to continuously evaluate the technical and functional requirements of your project. If the need for more advanced customization arises, considering Skills might be necessary.

## Action Plan

To effectively implement Connectors or Skills, consider the following steps:

1. **Performance Overview**: Assess performance needs and peak usage to estimate the number of API calls required.
2. **Limit Adjustments**: Adjust limits as necessary and manage these changes from an Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) perspective.
3. **Performance Testing**: Conduct thorough performance testing to ensure the chosen method meets your requirements.

By carefully evaluating your project's needs and understanding the capabilities of both Skills and Connectors, you can make informed decisions that align with your goals and resources.
