# Azure DevOps : Easy deploy Power platform solutions.

I have been a Azure DevOps enthousiast for years. The ease of use, flexibility of the platform are super. In this article I am sharing my take on deploying a Power Platform Solution across environments.

## Pipelines  - build artifact
I see pipelines as a means to create a deployable artifact of deployable item. 
 
## Pipelines  - Release
