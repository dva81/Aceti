  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>You might have heard the term DevOps and
  wondered if it is a new process, a new technology, a job title or something
  entirely different. Or maybe you’re more tech-savvy and automatically thought
  about continuous delivery, agile and infrastructure as code. But it is much
  more than that.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>WHAT IS DEVOPS?</span></h1>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Definitions vary, but as the name
  suggests, DevOps integrates the two traditionally separate development and IT
  operations teams in order to emphasize efficient communication to improve
  collaboration and productivity.</span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal>The ultimate goal of DevOps is focusing on the customers’

  <h1><span lang=EN-US>KEY BENEFITS FOR CUSTOMERS</span></h1>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I am a DevOps Evangelist and became team
  coach about a year ago. The team consists of technical and business
  consultants with focus on&nbsp;ECM&nbsp;product implementations (OpenText’s
  Captiva, Documentum and InfoArchive, Microsoft and BOX). We were delivering
  projects on time and within budget but morale was not on the expected level,
  so it became clear pretty fast that our project methodology could use a
  refresh. We set out to introduce DevOps and change the culture and way of
  working in our company.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white;vertical-align:
  baseline'><span style='color:black'>DevOps is all about improving
  the&nbsp;flow from development to customer and back, to help us&nbsp;deliver
  the best possible results and overall experience to the end-users. The&nbsp;key
  benefits&nbsp;of DevOps which we have experienced are:</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>FASTER&nbsp;IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND FEATURES</span></h2>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>By&nbsp;writing software&nbsp;in small
  chunks that are integrated, tested, monitored and deployed –usually in hours
  versus weeks or months in traditional methodologies – &nbsp;we are able to
  implement changes or offer new solutions faster and more often. In short, we
  improved our ability to solve customers’ Enterprise Content Management
  challenges and reciprocated to their needs efficiently.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>HIGH QUALITY AND MORE STABILITY&nbsp;</span></h2>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>More speed didn’t compromise on quality.
  While continuous delivery by itself is a high quality service indicator, we
  were also able to reduce unplanned work and rework, as well as the time spent
  dealing with security issues. The cross-disciplinary approach of DevOps
  maximizes reliability in all areas. Our higher response rate to any requests
  also adds up to increased stability, which is key for any business platform.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>QUICKER DETECTION AND RESOLUTION OF PROBLEMS</span></h2>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Thanks to better communication and
  collaboration between operations, software development and customer teams, we
  improved the feedback loops to quickly mitigate software defects at any stage
  of the development cycle. In the event of a new release crashing or otherwise
  disabling the current systems, we were also able to accelerate recovery from
  downtime. This allows us to proactively identify and resolve vulnerabilities
  before they impact our customers.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>REDUCED HUMAN ERRORS</span></h2>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white;vertical-align:
  baseline'><span style='color:black'><a
  href="https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/state-of-devops-report"
  target="_blank"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"inherit",serif;
  color:blue;text-decoration:none'>Research</span></a>&nbsp;shows approximately
  30% of the development process can be automated, including configuration
  management, testing, deployments and change approval processes. Replacing
  cookbooks for all these tasks with automated procedures helps in getting a
  steady output to our customers, by having the code base in a ready-to-deploy
  state, and reduces manual mistakes which could otherwise happen.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>INCREASED ADDED VALUE AND INNOVATION</span></h2>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>By reducing change failure rates and
  downtime recovery times, our cross-functional teams had more time to collect
  and implement customer feedback, even at early stages. From these inputs,
  they could change requirements or specifications, giving them more room to
  innovate and provide more value to the customer. Improved communication,
  knowledge sharing and experimentation implicit in DevOps also spreads
  innovative ideas more easily through all the customer projects.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>IMPROVED EMPLOYEE ATTITUDE</span></h2>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We also used a Guild approach, which
  provides a horizontal communication layer across our Product Engineering
  teams. Our engineers, testers, and other staff use them to set their own
  missions, to establish technical roadmaps, to take on joint tasks and to
  promote knowledge sharing. This initiative, combined with the increased
  involvement of all in the development lifecycle, leads to happier, more
  collaborative and productive teams, and this culture shift is likely to
  spread outside the company.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As businesses pursue&nbsp;digital
  transformation strategies, there’s an increasing need for rapid and
  continuous deployment of business platforms such as Content Management
  and&nbsp;collaboration technologies. These platforms can be synonymous with
  innovation, and the sooner this innovation gets implemented, the better for
  the company.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The solutions provider’s performance
  becomes crucial to enable customers to achieve their mission and remain
  competitive, and this is where the DevOps methodology comes to play. You’ll
  get faster updates, which means happier end-users and the ability to provide
  better customer service. Ultimately, the high performance of your technology
  partner can be converted into high performance of your business.</span></p>
